# Online-Student-Readiness-Project
This project was an internship project I completed for the ITS department at Alfred State College. In this project I was tasked to build a script, or multiple scripts, that grabbed the Student ID information for all students who got a 80% or higher on the the Exit Test for the Online Student Readiness course.
